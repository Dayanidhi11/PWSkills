1. Tags:

(a) Tags are special keywords enclosed in angle brackets < > that define the beginning and end of HTML elements. Tags are used to providing structure and meaning to the document.
(b) Tags are case-insensitive in HTML.
(c) Most HTML elements consist of an opening tag, a closing tag, and the content between them. The closing tag is identical to the opening tag but with a forward slash / before the tag name.

2. Elements:

(a) Elements are made up of both opening and closing tags, along with the content they enclose. An element represents a specific piece of content or a structural component on a web page.
(b) Elements are the building blocks of an HTML document and are used to define text, images, links, headings, paragraphs, and other content types.
(c) Elements can also have attributes, which provide additional information or properties about the element. Attributes are placed within the opening tag.

Example:

<p>This is a <strong>paragraph</strong> of text with <a href="https://www.example.com">a link</a>.</p>

In this example:

<p> is the opening tag for a paragraph element.
</p> is the closing tag for the same paragraph element.
Inside the paragraph, we have more elements:
<strong> is used for strong or emphasized text.
</strong> is the closing tag for the strong element.
<a> is used for creating hyperlinks and includes an href attribute that specifies the URL.
</a> is the closing tag for the anchor (link) element.
Together, the HTML tags and elements structure and define the content of the web page. When rendered in a web browser, this example would display a paragraph of text with a portion of it emphasized and a hyperlink to an external website.
