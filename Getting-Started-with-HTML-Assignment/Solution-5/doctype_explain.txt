Q5: What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?
Solution:

1. The Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE) in HTML is a statement that specifies the type and version of the markup language used in an HTML document.
2. It is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document and helps the web browser understand how to render the content of the page.
3. The DOCTYPE declaration is not an HTML tag but a document metadata.

Here's an example of a DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5:
<!DOCTYPE html>

In this example, <!DOCTYPE html> is the DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5. It's simple and concise, and it's used for modern web pages. HTML5 doesn't require a more complex DOCTYPE declaration like previous versions of HTML.

It's important to include the DOCTYPE declaration at the very beginning of our HTML document, before the <html> tag, to ensure proper rendering and behavior in web browsers. Failure to include a valid DOCTYPE can lead to compatibility issues and inconsistent rendering of our web page across different browsers.
