1. Comments in HTML serve the purpose of providing human-readable notes or explanations within the HTML code.
2. These comments are not displayed in the web page when viewed in a browser but can be useful for documentation and code organization.
3. Comments can be helpful for debugging.

In HTML, comments are written using the <!-- and --> delimiters. Anything enclosed within these delimiters will be treated as a comment and will not be rendered in the web page.

Here's an example of how to use comments in an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    
    <!-- This is a comment. It provides additional information about the following paragraph. -->
    <p>This is the main content of my web page. It can include text, images, links, and more.</p>
    
    <!--
    We can also use multi-line comments like this.
    These comments can span across multiple lines.
    -->
    
    <p>Feel free to explore the site and learn more about HTML and web development!</p>
</body>
</html>

In this example:

The comments are enclosed within <!-- and --> delimiters.
The first comment provides additional information about the paragraph that follows it.
The second comment demonstrates a multi-line comment.
